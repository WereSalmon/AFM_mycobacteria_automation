    "Long term time lapse atomic force microscopy (LTTL-AFM) is a groundbreaking new technique for imaging bacteria in high resolution, developped by Dr Alexander Eskandarian. It allows us to observe how physical properties of the bacterial cell surface, detected by high resolution AFM, change over time. We can then examine how those properties change around important events such as cell division. Eskandarian et al (2017), Hannebelle et al (2020), and Odermatt et al (2020) have all identified such properties by examining this data manually including: wave troughs which division events localize to, furrows which occur several minutes before the development of the FTSZ ring, changes in stiffness on the cell surface, and nano-vesicles appearing on the cell surface. This technique has also made it easy to observe the growth of bacterial cells much more accurately than in previous work (Hannebelle et al, 2020), and we may even relate this growth to the previous physical features  mentioned. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to automate the process of finding and detecting biophysical features in images of several cells, and thus produce a large and accurate dataset of them for further study. We would also like to automate the measurement of cell growth and divsion events, both to study them and relate them to relevant biophysical features. This requires images to be processed, aligned, and segmented into masks which must have false masks filtered out, be tracked over time and have their biophysical features identified. Building on a project by Keegan Flannagan and Hasti Delfi several different programs are used to porcess and segment the images, and skeletonize and analyze the masks of cells in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gwyddion (an external desktop program), Cellpose (a neurel-net based python package which segments and creates masks of cells), PyTracker (a program which implements single particle tracking to track cells over time), SciKit Image (a python image processing package which produces skeletons of masks), and a pole-based method for turning skeletons into centerlines of the cell. Then division events can be identified and biophysical features of the cell can be tracked along the centerline. "

    "### 3.2.6 Skeletonization of individual cells\n",
    "\n",
    "by Samuel Munn\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm takes the individual cell masks (Figure) as inputs. It then creates the topological skeleton of the mask's shape using the skeletonize function in skimage.morphology, Python's Scikit Image package. skeletonize uses Zhang's algorithm to create the skeleton from a binary image. (Zhang, 1984) This creates the initial skeleton, which often splits into two or more branches at either end of the cell (Figure). This workflow solves this problem by finding the poles of the cell and then extending the skeleton to those poles. This can be completed using the function \"prune2\" in tools.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the poles of the cell first the \"explore_poles\" function in tools.py finds the set $S$ of extreme points in the mask as follows: starting with a smoothed curve (a periodic 3-spline) fitted to the points in the outline we find the radius at any given point on the outline as the distance from the outline to it's centroid. We then find the set of extreme points to be all local maxima of this radial distance function. We then divide $S$ into two subsets based on which side of the short axis of bounding box the extreme points fall on. We will call these subsets $S_1$ and $S_2$. The poles $P_1$ and $P_2$ are then defined as the weighted averages of their respective subsets, weighted by the radii of the extreme points.\n",
    "\n",
    "prune2 then executes an algorithm  then crop all skeletons which do not intersect the outline near the poles, and choose the longest path through the skeleton to be the basis for the centerline. We then fit a smooth curve to this path (a 3-spline), ending at the poles nearest to it's ends. If the curvature does not exceed a certain threshold (standard threshold is 0.2) then it is converted into a binary image and returned as the centerline. If the centerline's cuvature does exceed this threshold the ends of the path through the skeleton are cropped, and the process of fitting a spline repeated. This new spline is then converted to a binary image and returned as the centerline."

    "### 3.2.7 Using RadFil to build and analyze the radial profile\n",
    "\n",
    "by Keegan Flannagan\n",
    "\n",
    "RadFil is a python package that was originally designed to measure the radial profiles of interstellar filaments, but can be readily applied to other structures such as cells (Zucker et al., 2018). Radfil was chosen for this analyses because it grants the user full control over the parameters used to build and fit the radial profiles and because of the convenient way it packages the output data.\n",
    "\n",
    "RadFil takes the cell image, mask, and skeleton from each isolated cell as input. It then performs spline interpolation by fitting a b-spline to the original skeleton which creates a smoothed, continuous version of the original skeleton. RadFil then creates a series of cuts at even points along the skeleton which are perpendicular to the tangent of the skeleton at each cut point. These perpendicular cuts extend to the edge of the cell mask, and can therefore be used to compute the radius or diameter of the cell at every point along the skeleton. RadFil also saves the pixel intensities along the smoothed skeleton, which can be used to calculate the height along the skeleton which is also known as the ridgeline. "
